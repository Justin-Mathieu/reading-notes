## Html Chapter 2 (*Text*)

> Html elemants create the structure and emphasis or semantic value. Examples would be heading, subheadings or paragraphs.
> The tags create the emphasis in the content such as line breaks, bold or italics.

## Hml Chapter 10 (*Introducing CSS*)

> CSS is usually wrtitten in a separte document, but can be written in line with the html.  
> CSS or cascading style sheets ties into the elements of html and declares how those elements should look on the page. CSS rules have two parts a selector and a declaration. The selector is the element or tag that is being modified. the selector is the modification thst is being made.the declaration is encased by curly brackets.
>The declaration is also made of two parts the property and the value.
>
> **Example**
>> `P  
{background-color:green}`

## JavaScript Chapter 2 (*Basic JavaScript Instructions*)

> Arrays are a type of data used to store more than one piece of information.  
> A script is a collection of instructions to be carried out.  
> A variable is a place to store information to be called on later in the script.  
> To decalre a variable you must name it, once you have decalred your variable and named it then you need add an operator and the informatin that is going to be returned or stored.
> **Example:**
>> `let bannana = 5;`

## JavaScript Chapter 10 (*Decisions and Loops*)  \

> A switch statement sets a value and base on the value runs a block of code that corespopnds with that value.  
> Loops evaluate the condition until it reutrns to be true. There are mulpiple types of loops such as a while loop, ado while loop and a for loop.  
> To compare two vlaue in a state mwnt you can use comparison operataors.which constist ogf two operands and one operator in the middle. Operands can also be expressions encased in parenthesis. These values are usually returnd as a boolean.  
> Logical operatots compare two expressions as one.  
> An if ataemnet evaluates a condition and execute the appropriat code block.
>If else statements are the executions that can be made based on the evaluation of the condition.  
> In JavaScript decisions can be broken in to two parts a statement that gets evaluated and conditional statement the declare what the script should do when the evaluations are made.  
> **Example:**

```
If(this is a condition){
    console. log(this is what happens if the condition is met or not)
}
```
