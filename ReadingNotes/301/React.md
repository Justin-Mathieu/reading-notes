# React Reading Notes

## **Component Based Architecture**  

- A component is  a modular and reusable peice of functionality that can be imported.  
- A component is an object that is functional and interfaces with other components.  
***Charactaristics***
- Components are reusable.  
- Components are designed to be replaced ny similar components.  
- Componcents should be able to be used in different environments and contexts.  
- Components should be modular and be modified to do differnt tasks.  
- Components should be user friendly.  
- Components should be independant of eachother.  
***Advantages***  
- Independent components make deployment easier.  
- Cost effective.  
- Independent components make development easier.  
- Reuseable components can be used for a variety of applications.  
- Complexity can be easily modified.  
- The reliabillity of the components makes the whole application more reliable.  
- Components amke the whole application modular.
- The independant nature of the components make collaboration easier.  

## **Props**  

- Props is the keyword used to pass data from one component to another and is short for properties.  
- Data is passed in a uni-directional flow.  
- Data is read only and can not be changed by children.  
- The first step to uong props is to define an attribute and value.  
- The second step is to pass to the child component using props.  
- The final step is to render the data.  
- Props returns an object.
