## Scaling Up with Reducer and Context

How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application?  
 (At least two paragraphs of prose.)  

- Use reducer and use context work to gether to simplify state management by working in tandem to simplify  
the passage of state to lower components. In order to use the two you must create context with  
the use context hook which allows all of the state to be manged in one place. the reducer hook then manages  
all of the logic involved with managing thata state. Adding the dispatch to the context allows the state to  
be changed and updated.
