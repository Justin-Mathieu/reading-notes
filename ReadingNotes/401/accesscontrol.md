# Access Control

## 5 Steps To RBAC

What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?

- Access is assigned based on the role the person has as what systems need to access in order to build some safe guards against cyber attacks, for example all of the data is not compromised if one person gerts hacked.  

Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC.

- A manager might have a different role and permission than the people under or above him.

What approach might you take to implement RBAC?

- First would be to inventrory the systems and work force to create roles, then assign the roles to the workforce periodically reviewing the implementation to ensure it is effective.

## RBCA

If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?

- Authorization is that you have the right credentials to be doing what you are doing.  

Name three primary rules defined for RBAC.

- Do not make changes on an individual basis. all or nothing whole system and keep it as small as possible.

Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.

- The implementation of restricting access to those who do not need it in order to safe guard against threats.

## RBCA Tutorial  

What Are access rights Associated with? The User? or The Role? Explain.

- The user is associated with the role and the role is associated with the rights. In other words the role are assigned to the rights an the user happens to be in that role getting the rights to access the system.  

Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a user successfully does what?

- The user must be authenticated in order to verify who they are in order to authorize access to the correct system.  

Explain how RBAC might benefit a business.

- No updating policy hen employees come ands go, easy to add people to the RBAC system. RBCA is also scaleble in the way that just changing roles can give acess to new parts of the system.
