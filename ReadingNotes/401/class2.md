# Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD

## Intro to NodeJS and Express

Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.

- Middleware is the software that makes it possible for the application and database to talk to eachother.  

Express the most popular ________.

- Node web framework.

Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

- Flexible and it is up to the developer to chose the best tools for the application EXpress gives choices and does not have one rihght way.

What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

- A module is a file that can be imported into other parts of the code. Modularity can help organizeand clean up code as well as keeping variable names fspecific the file they are in.

## What is NPM

What version of npm are you running on your machine?

- 8.13.2

What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

- npm i jshint

## What is TDD

Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

- Test keep the code to the least amout while still acheiving the outcome and are a good way to ensure your code is doing what you expect.

What are three expected benefits of testing

- Lower defect rates.
- Reduction in effort in the final phases of projects
- Can lead to technically better code.

Name at least 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

#### **Individual**

- Too many tests
- Too large of tests.

#### **Team**

- Not fully adopting the process.
- Not maintaining tests causing long run times.

## CI/CD

What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?

-

What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

- Contiunous delivery is building the project in a way that lets you relaese it at anytime.Contiunuous deployment is the deployment of features as they are built.

Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background

- GitHub builds the project and runs the neccesary tests to check if the commit is able to merge.
