# Terminal Practice

## Comand Line

- A command line is a interface to run command instead of using a traditional gui.
- The shell is the part of the operating system that handles how the shell behaves.

This was pretty straight forward, although the comand in the tutorial did not work for my terminal I did get the desired outcome with a different command(echo $0) and did see that the echo command can be in other ways.  

## Basic Navigation

- `pwd` prints the currrent file you are in.  
- `Ls` prints the contents of the file you are in.  
- Absolute Paths are the paths to a specfic file and use / to decribe the path.  
- Relative paths are pointing to a location and do not use a /.  
-`~` = home directory  
- `.`= current directory.  
- `..` = Parent directory.  
- Cd is used to change directories using the file name.  
- Tab can be used to auto complete.

This was a good refresher on the basics of moving around the terminal. and had some cool shortcuts that I didnt know about and will definitly use in the future.

## More About Files

- Everything in linux is a file... everything!
- Linux does not use file extensions(ie .txt).
- Linux is case sensitive and the same commands with different casing are different comands.
- When naming files spaces are ok but can be confusing.
- Quotes are single items.
- `\` is the escape character.
- `.` is a hidden file or directory and can be seen with -a.

The fact that everything in linux is file is really interesting and ai would like to learn more about that. Its also helpful to know the case sensitiviesand quote meaning so I dont mess that up in the future and can be confiodent in what i am doing.

## Manual Pages

- `man <comand>` looks  up the comand and gives infomation on how to use it and the argumements it takes.
- `man -k <search>` is search command in the manual pages
- `/<search>` searches the current page for the term. and can be cycled through using n.

I wish I had known about this earlier It seems very helpful when just starting to use the command line.

## File Manipulation

- `mkdir` is used to make a directory.
- `mkdir -p` is used to make parent directories
- `mkdir -pv` is used to view the parent directories as you create them.
- `rmdir` is used to remove directory.
- `rmdir` also supports `-p` and `-v`.
- `cp` is used to copy files or directories.
- `mv` is used to move files or directories.

This tutorial has been the most helpful, especially the copying and moving files. In the future i would like to do some clean up on my file structure and this will help me do that effectivly.
