# Event Driven Applications

## Event Driven Programming

What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

- Event emitter is the native module that lets us implement event driven programming. there are faster versions as well, event emitter 2 and 3

What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

- Allows functions to be run when an event is triggered creating an easier way for the objects to communicate with eachother and requires let work to call functions on objects.

Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

- Event driven programming could be useful in the way that it would allow for events to be triggerd much esier and multiple events could be triggered at once as well as reused. While making the code simple to write.
