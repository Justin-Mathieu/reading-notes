# Data Structures and Algorithms  

What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

- Effeiciency and space complexity should be considered when deciding which data structure to use.  

How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

- recursive functions need a base case in order to stop calling themselve indefinitly.
