# **Class 14 Reading Notes**

## CSS Transforms

> Two  properties 2D and 3D.  
> 2D transforms work on both x and y axis.  
> 3D works on x, y and z axis.  
> The rotate value rotates the element up to 360 degrees.  
> Positive = clockwise negative = counter clockwise.
>Transform can scale an element.
> The skew value distorts the element on the axis specified.  
> backface visiblity can be used to hide the element if it is altered to facing away from the screen.  

## CSS Transitions and Animations.

> In order to use a transition change needs to be made. for example (hover focus active)  
> To create a transition the properties property, duration, and timing-function can be used.  
> The property Property specifies what will be changed.  
> The duration property specifies the duration of the transition.  
>The timing function property specifies the speed of the transition.  
> The key frames rule contains the element being animated, the name of the animation and the aimation breakpoints.  
> Animations can only be applied to one element at a time.
